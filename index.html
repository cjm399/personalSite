            <p>Hello, I’m Chris, a programmer with a primary focus on video game development, 
            living in the Philadelphia area. I am a 2020 Drexel Grad with a BS in Computer Science, 
            a concentration in game development, and a Minor in Mathematics. I love to learn, 
            create, read, write, cook, and entertain.</p>

            <p>Of all the things in my career I am most proud of my Senior Project Team winning 
            “Best Student Game” at Games For Change 2020, with our game Resilience. I am also proud 
            of having launched Sole with Gossamer Games on the Xbox One, and on Steam, back in October of 2019.</p>

            <p>During my time at Drexel, I started working as a gameplay programmer at Gossamer Games. 
            For three years, I worked on the company’s debut game, Sole. This was the most exhilarating 
            project I have ever worked on. The team has had the privilege of being a finalist for the IGF 
            "Best Student Game" award in 2019 as well as a finalist for the GANG awards for 
            “Best Original Soundtrack Album” 2020. We are thrilled to have released Sole in October 2019 on PC and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>I continue to push myself to new heights working on projects that I care about. 
            I want to continue to push my online presence through my Twitter and YouTube profiles as well
            as posting to my blog. I plan to continue working on games as part of my personal and professional life.</p>
